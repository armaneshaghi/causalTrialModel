# Causal modelling of mechanistic pathways in a clinical trial

This repository has a Jupyter Notebook showing the codes used in the manuscript entitled "Applying causal models to explore the mechanism of action of simvastatin in progressive multiple sclerosis", published at PNAS ( https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/08/1818978116).

This Jupyter Notebook is self-contained (you do not need to download any data), because it uses the covariance matrix of the data to produce a new dataset that has a similar underlying statistical properties without exposing any of the individual patient data. Therefore this code will give you _similar_ results as my manuscript but not exactly the __same__.
