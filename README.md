# Causal modelling of mechanistic pathways in a clinical trial

This repository has a Jupyter Notebook showing the codes used in the manuscript entitled "Applying causal models to explore the mechanism of action of simvastatin in progressive multiple sclerosis", which as of 12 February 2019 is under-review.  

This Jupyter Notebook is self-contained (you do not need to download any data), because it uses the covariance matrix of the data to produce a new dataset that has a similar underlying statistical properties without exposing any of the individual patient data. Therefore this code will give you _similar_ results as my manuscript but not exactly the __same__.
