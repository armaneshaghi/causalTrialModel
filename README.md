# Causal modelling of mechanistic pathways in a clinical trial

This repository has a Jupyter notebook showing part of the codes used in the manuscript entitled "Application of mechanistic methods to clinical trials in multiple sclerosis: the simvastatin case". 

This notebook is still work in progress, but at the moment provides codes necessary to reproduce many of the results of the manuscript.
